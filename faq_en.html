    	<h1>gottaFeeling Frequently Asked Questions:</h1>
    	<ol>
    		<li>What is gottaFeeling?</li>
    		<p>When is the last time you stopped to ask yourself, How am I feeling right now? gottaFeeling is a mobile application to help you get in touch with your feelings on a daily basis. Thoughts, like waves in an ocean, come and go, but feelings are instructive. Learning how to tap into them and learning the words to express those feelings can lead to better judgment, more confidence and ultimately self-awareness.</p>

    		<li>What is the difference between a feeling and a thought?</li>
    		<p>If you can substitute "I am" for "I feel", you have expressed a feeling. If you can substitute "I think" for "I feel", you have expressed a thought or a judgment. Said another way, when "feel" is followed by "that," "like," or "as" in a sentence, you are most likely expressing an opinion or thought, not a feeling. For example, saying "I feel that you are not paying attention to me" is an observation, not a feeling. </p>

    		<li>How is identifying and tracking your feelings helpful?</li>
    		<p>Ever notice how the moment you recognize how you feel and express it you feel better? The simple act of identifying an emotion can help you manage your emotions. Over time, the ability to look back and see how you have been feeling and why can help you make better judgments. </p>

    		<li>What purpose do emotions serve?</li>
    		<p>Emotions can convey information and make us more powerful communicators when used correctly, they help us to understand ourselves and they help others to understand us, and they can be an early detection system - cluing us in on issues we may have.</p>

    		<li>Why are there so many more "negative" emotions listed?</li>
    		<p>Here at gottaFeeling we do not classify emotions as negative or positive.  We believe that emotions are simply emotions.  If we stop classifying emotions as negative or positive, we may be more inclined to feel them - even the ones that make us feel uncomfortable.  Interestingly, it is the avoidance of feeling certain emotions that prolongs them.</p>

    		<li>Why the long list of words?</li>
    		<p>We specifically want our users to learn a vocabulary for feelings.  It's subtle, but the more you hunt down a word to express what you're feeling, the better you become at putting words to feelings and once you have words for feelings, you are better able to communicate how you feel.</p>

    		<li>Is gottaFeeling a substitute for therapy or professional help?</li>
    		<p>No. But we think it's a nice complement to your professional help. You can choose to share your reports with friends, colleagues and even those you go to for professional help. </p>

    		<li>Can I download my logged feelings data?</li>
    		<p>Yes! Simply purchase the advanced reports for a one-time fee and in addition to reports, you will be granted the ability to email yourself a CSV file with all your logged data. After purchase, this feature will show up in the settings section of the app. </p>

    		<li>I'm not getting my reminders anymore, what's wrong?</li>
    		<p>iOS 5 introduced Notification Center and it's possible that the notifications for gottaFeeling were turned off as part of the upgrade. Here's how to check:  Go to the Settings App, tap on Notifications, then gottaFeeling. Make sure that notifications are enabled and the Alert Style is not set to None.  Also, be sure you have downloaded the latest platform update for your device.</p>

    		<li>What does gottaFeeling do with my feelings data?</li>
    		<p>Nothing. We don't sell or use your feelings information for marketing purposes. The application simply helps you track your feelings over time so you have a record of your feelings and can start understanding why, when and where you feel the way you do. </p>

    		<li>How do I learn more?</li>
